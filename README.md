# 2020 Portfolio Website
This is my new portfolio website for the new decade! My last site was feeling a bit old and clunky after having it for a couple years, so I thought I'd go ahead and rewrite it. With this iteration, I'll be supporting pre-rendering to improve performance and SEO reach, and going for a flatter/simpler design. 

## Some Details
- Written with Vue, vue-router, vuex and babel/webpack. 

## Building and Running
- Make sure you've got `npm` installed.
- Download the repo and run `npm install` to download any dependencies. 
- Use the command `npm run serve` to run a hot-reload version of the website on a local server. 
- Use the command `npm run build` to build the pre-rendered static files for deployment.
